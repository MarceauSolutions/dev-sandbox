## Known Issues / Open Items
| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| n8n workflow backup | **Low** | Weekly launchd job active (Sun 4am). Last backup: 2026-03-06 (40 workflows, post all fixes). Use `python scripts/backup-n8n.py --commit` to backup + auto-commit. |
| Stripe: legacy `webhooks.marceausolutions.com` endpoint | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 6) | Was returning 404 but still registered in Stripe — removed. Added missing `stripe-webdev-payment` endpoint. All 4 Stripe webhooks now point to n8n. |
| Twilio SMS webhook empty on local PT + HVAC numbers | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 6) | +12398803365 and +12397666129 had no SMS webhook — inbound texts dropped. Set to `sms-response` handler. |
| `lead_manager.py:760` | Low | TODO: email notification on CRM stage transitions |
| `amazon_sp_api.py:417` | Low | Hardcoded USD — doesn't support multi-marketplace |
| `agent_bridge_api.py` | Medium | 13,050 lines — modularization planned |
| n8n MCP string/int ID bug | Low | MCP tools expect int IDs, n8n uses strings — use curl via SSH as workaround |
| PT Monday Check-in cron corruption | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Was corrupted with ls output, fixed to 0 14 * * 1 |
| Self-Annealing Switch node | FIXED 2026-03-06 | typeVersion 3 incompatible with n8n 2.4.8, downgraded to v1 |
| GitHub→Telegram credential | FIXED 2026-03-06 | "Clawdbot Telegram" n8n credential had stale bot token. Updated via API. Verified working on next push. |
| Deleted Google Sheets credential `RIFdaHtNYdTpFnlu` | FIXED 2026-03-06 | 3 webdev workflows referenced deleted credential. Remapped to `mywn8S0xjRx9YM9K`. |
| X-Batch-Image-Generator broken connection | FIXED 2026-03-06 | `Update Media_URL` pointed to non-existent "Rate Limit (Wait)" node. Fixed via SQLite to "Wait 5s (Rate Limit)". |
| Challenge-Day7-Upsell sheetName lookup | FIXED 2026-03-06 | `mode:name` caused runtime API lookup failure. Changed to `mode:id` (gid=0). |
| Weekly-Campaign-Analytics Twilio type mismatch | FIXED 2026-03-06 | httpBasicAuth cred created (`hS85CMA24G8bUxDY`) for Twilio HTTP node. |
| Follow-Up-Sequence-Engine no credentials | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Google Sheets + 3 Twilio nodes had empty credential refs. Fixed via SQLite. |
| Hot-Lead-to-ClickUp active with no ClickUp stack | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Deactivated. ClickUp not in stack — Hot-Lead-to-ClickUp moved to inactive. |
| Clawdbot invalid `model` key in config | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Top-level `model` key not valid in clawdbot.json schema — caused config reload failures. Removed. |
| Daily-Operations-Digest corrupted cron + no credentials | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Same ls-injection bug as PT Monday Check-in. Fixed cron to `0 0 13 * * *` (8am ET, 6-field). Assigned Gmail/Sheets/SMTP credentials. Fixed workflow_history version. Now active and scheduled. |
| Resume-Builder Email Delivery no Gmail credential | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Gmail node had no credential assigned. Assigned Gmail account (`Fy8WXPJMuD57XWjw`). |
| Follow-Up-Sequence-Engine no credentials | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Twilio (×3) and Google Sheets nodes had empty credentials. All fixed. |
| SQLite cron fixes missing workflow_history update | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | n8n reads workflow_history (not workflow_entity) on activation. All SQLite node fixes must also update workflow_history.nodes for the current versionId. |
| Webdev-Monthly-Checkin only ran in January | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | triggerAtMonth:1 in schedule parameters limited workflow to January. Removed field — now runs 1st of every month. |
| 5-field cronExpression in scheduleTrigger nodes | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | n8n scheduleTrigger (typeVersion 1.2) requires 6-field cron (seconds first). Fixed 6 workflows: X-Batch, X-Social-Scheduler (×2), PT-Monday-Checkin, Challenge-Day7, Monthly-Backup. All bounced and active. |
| SQLite-patched workflows stale in n8n memory | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | All 8 workflows patched via SQLite in session 3 were bounced (deactivate/activate via API) to reload from DB. |
| Mac has no autonomous health monitoring | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | Added launchd: daily health check (7am) + weekly revenue report (Mon 9am). Both loaded and registered. |
