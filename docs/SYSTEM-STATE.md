## Known Issues / Open Items
| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| n8n workflow backup | **Low** | Weekly launchd job active (Sun 4am). Last backup: 2026-03-06 21:20 (40 workflows, post all session 7 fixes including Self-Annealing wiring). Use `python scripts/backup-n8n.py --commit` to backup + auto-commit. |
| Stripe: legacy `webhooks.marceausolutions.com` endpoint | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 6) | Was returning 404 but still registered in Stripe — removed. Added missing `stripe-webdev-payment` endpoint. All 4 Stripe webhooks now point to n8n. |
| Twilio SMS webhook empty on local PT + HVAC numbers | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 6) | +12398803365 and +12397666129 had no SMS webhook — inbound texts dropped. Set to `sms-response` handler. |
| `lead_manager.py:760` | Low | TODO: email notification on CRM stage transitions |
| `amazon_sp_api.py:417` | Low | Hardcoded USD — doesn't support multi-marketplace |
| `agent_bridge_api.py` | Medium | 13,050 lines — modularization planned |
| n8n MCP string/int ID bug | Low | MCP tools expect int IDs, n8n uses strings — use curl via SSH as workaround |
| PT Monday Check-in cron corruption | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Was corrupted with ls output, fixed to 0 14 * * 1 |
| Self-Annealing Switch node | FIXED 2026-03-06 | typeVersion 3 incompatible with n8n 2.4.8, downgraded to v1 |
| GitHub→Telegram credential | FIXED 2026-03-06 | "Clawdbot Telegram" n8n credential had stale bot token. Updated via API. Verified working on next push. |
| Deleted Google Sheets credential `RIFdaHtNYdTpFnlu` | FIXED 2026-03-06 | 3 webdev workflows referenced deleted credential. Remapped to `mywn8S0xjRx9YM9K`. |
| X-Batch-Image-Generator broken connection | FIXED 2026-03-06 | `Update Media_URL` pointed to non-existent "Rate Limit (Wait)" node. Fixed via SQLite to "Wait 5s (Rate Limit)". |
| Challenge-Day7-Upsell sheetName lookup | FIXED 2026-03-06 | `mode:name` caused runtime API lookup failure. Changed to `mode:id` (gid=0). |
| Weekly-Campaign-Analytics Twilio type mismatch | FIXED 2026-03-06 | httpBasicAuth cred created (`hS85CMA24G8bUxDY`) for Twilio HTTP node. |
| Follow-Up-Sequence-Engine no credentials | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Google Sheets + 3 Twilio nodes had empty credential refs. Fixed via SQLite. |
| Hot-Lead-to-ClickUp active with no ClickUp stack | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Deactivated. ClickUp not in stack — Hot-Lead-to-ClickUp moved to inactive. |
| Clawdbot invalid `model` key in config | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Top-level `model` key not valid in clawdbot.json schema — caused config reload failures. Removed. |
| Daily-Operations-Digest corrupted cron + no credentials | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Same ls-injection bug as PT Monday Check-in. Fixed cron to `0 0 13 * * *` (8am ET, 6-field). Assigned Gmail/Sheets/SMTP credentials. Fixed workflow_history version. Now active and scheduled. |
| Resume-Builder Email Delivery no Gmail credential | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Gmail node had no credential assigned. Assigned Gmail account (`Fy8WXPJMuD57XWjw`). |
| Follow-Up-Sequence-Engine no credentials | FIXED 2026-03-06 | Twilio (×3) and Google Sheets nodes had empty credentials. All fixed. |
| SQLite cron fixes missing workflow_history update | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | n8n reads workflow_history (not workflow_entity) on activation. All SQLite node fixes must also update workflow_history.nodes for the current versionId. |
| Webdev-Monthly-Checkin only ran in January | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | triggerAtMonth:1 in schedule parameters limited workflow to January. Removed field — now runs 1st of every month. |
| 5-field cronExpression in scheduleTrigger nodes | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | n8n scheduleTrigger (typeVersion 1.2) requires 6-field cron (seconds first). Fixed 6 workflows: X-Batch, X-Social-Scheduler (×2), PT-Monday-Checkin, Challenge-Day7, Monthly-Backup. All bounced and active. |
| SQLite-patched workflows stale in n8n memory | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | All 8 workflows patched via SQLite in session 3 were bounced (deactivate/activate via API) to reload from DB. |
| Mac has no autonomous health monitoring | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 4) | Added launchd: daily health check (7am) + weekly revenue report (Mon 9am). Both loaded and registered. |
| GitHub→Telegram stale Telegram credential | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 7) | "Clawdbot Telegram" cred `RlAwU3xzcX4hifgj` had stale/encrypted token. Re-PATCHED via n8n API. Was causing 5 errors per push. |
| health_check.py missing n8n restart + domain checks | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 7) | Added n8n restart counter (warns >1, fails >3 restarts/24h) and external domain health (n8n, api, fitai — all 200). |
| invoice.payment_failed unhandled | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 7b) | Created `Stripe-Payment-Failed` workflow (`QMWkhAb8SWMSImc4`). Stripe webhook `we_1T85t0DeeD1eRvzzjpNKpvGA` registered. Payment failures now trigger Telegram alert to William. |
| flamesofpassionentertainment.com DNS not configured | **Client-blocked** | Domain on Google Cloud DNS (ns-cloud-c1-c4.googledomains.com). No A records pointing to GitHub Pages. Client or William must add A records: 185.199.108-111.153. GitHub Pages site is live at `marceausolutions.github.io/flames-of-passion-website`. |
| 7 workflows not wired to Self-Annealing | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 7) | Wired 7 remaining workflows (nurture sequences ×4, Add-Posts-Webhook, Resume-Builder, X-Post-Image-Generator). Now 34/36 active workflows wired. Only Self-Annealing + n8n-Health-Check excluded intentionally. |
| Stripe-Payment-Failed no client notification | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 8) | Updated workflow to: lookup client phone in PT Tracker → SMS client to update payment method → Telegram alert to William. Fully automated payment failure response. |
| invoice.paid unhandled (subscription renewals) | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 8) | Created `Stripe-Invoice-Paid` (`unF3M3IfnGPqV0xU`). Stripe webhook `we_1T862eDeeD1eRvzzdYkDJUzb` registered. Renewals now log to PT Tracker "Billing" tab + Telegram. Column mapping aligned with Coaching-Payment-Welcome (Date, Client_Name, Amount, Status=Renewal, Stripe_Payment_ID). |
| health_check.py missing Stripe webhook verification | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 8) | Added `check_stripe_webhooks()` — verifies all 6 Stripe webhooks are registered and enabled in Stripe. Fires as part of full health check. |
| boabfit.com not in domain monitoring | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 8) | Added `www.boabfit.com` to `check_domains()` in health_check.py. Live at 200. |
| health_check.py key-only AI API checks | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 9) | Added `check_ai_apis()` — live validation of Anthropic (GET /v1/models, zero token cost) and ElevenLabs (character quota). Fires before Stripe webhooks check. Both keys valid as of session 9. |
| revenue-report.py missing top-client breakdown | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 9) | Added "Top Clients by Revenue" section (top 5 by total_charged). Uses existing `by_customer` dict from `get_stripe_metrics()`. |
| X-Batch-Image-Generator erroring daily | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 9) | xAI API key invalid (403 on all endpoints from EC2). Was silently firing Self-Annealing handler 3x/day. Deactivated until key renewed at console.x.ai. X-Post-Image-Generator also uses xAI (webhook-triggered, no auto-errors). |
| Webdev-Monthly-Checkin running DAILY instead of monthly | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 9) | `{triggerAtDayOfMonth: 1, triggerAtHour: 10}` without `field` key defaults to DAILY in n8n. Was potentially SMS-ing web dev clients every day. Fixed to explicit `cronExpression: "0 0 10 1 * *"` (10 AM ET on 1st of month). Bounced. |
| daily_standup.sh broken morning digest command | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 9) | `python -m projects.shared.personal-assistant.src.morning_digest` fails (dashes in path). Fixed to subshell `(cd projects/shared/personal-assistant && python -m src.morning_digest --preview)`. |
| All Google Sheets mode:name nodes (19 total) | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 10) | mode:name does runtime API lookup that can fail under load. Converted ALL 19 nodes across 13 workflows to mode:id with verified GIDs. PT Tracker GIDs: Client Roster=1584175390, Billing=1695379925, Weekly Check-Ins=1875514153. Challenge GIDs: Leads=0. Also created 4 missing tabs: Form_Submissions, SMS_Responses, Follow_Up_Sequences (ops sheet), Premium Waitlist (challenge sheet). |
| All Google Sheets mode:list nodes (13 total) | FIXED 2026-03-06 (session 11) | mode:list does same runtime API lookup as mode:name. Converted all 13 nodes across 12 workflows to mode:id. WebDev Tracker GIDs: Web Dev Clients=1059444855, Cross-Referrals=1513866714. Challenge sheet GIDs: Responses=888740858, Campaign Analytics=1367234528. Created 3 new tabs: Creator Tool Leads=37201560, Website Design Leads=2082055740, Automation Leads=545218649. Zero mode:name/mode:list/mode:url nodes remain across all 37 active workflows. |
